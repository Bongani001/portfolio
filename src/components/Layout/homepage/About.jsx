        <p className='text-center z-0 text-gray-600 leading-loose py-5 md:w-5/6'>I’m a self-taught web developer, I am looking for a job of a web developer, since that’s what I’ve been doing already for four years in my free time. Developing websites for friends, developing simple e-shops with the help of some open source content-management systems, and so on. Besides that I am a normal guy who enjoys watching anime and spending time with friends, while not working or studying, which takes most of my time of course. If I should pick the best website I’ve designed up to this point, it will be this one: [name of the website]. I am ambitious and hard-working and believe you’ll give me a chance to prove my words.</p>
